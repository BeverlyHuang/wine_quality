# Wine Quality Classification

By Beverly Huang

### Goal
Wine can be classified into many different quality levels. This project will use â€œPortuguese Vinho Verde" wine dataset as an example to explore the relationship between wine quality and wine features and build a model to predict wine quality.

### Conclusion
Wine quality is correlated with features such as acidity and alcohol. The model created above can be used for predicting wine quality level based on wine features. Thus, once wine feature data are collected, this model can be used for wine quality classification and can be further used for pricing.
